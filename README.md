# MatrixOperations
This repository contains the source code that implements the four different versions of matrix operations.

1. The first version of this programming project is a C program that uses a regular stack dynamic two-dimensional array to represent the matrices.
2. The second version is also a C program but this version uses a pointer to a pointer that allocates memory in the heap instead of the stack using the malloc function to create dynamic two-dimensional matrices.
3. The third version is a C++ program that has a pointer to a pointer as private data in the “Matrix” class. This C++ version also has overloaded operator functions that perform matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
4. The fourth version is a Java program that uses two-dimensional arrays and appropriate methods for the matrix operations.
